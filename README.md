## Overview

What patterns emerge when millions of customers search for their perfect trip on the world's leading travel platform?

The following project aimed to answer specific questions relating to **search patterns** that emerged in datasets obtained from **Expedia**. 
The analyses were performed using the programming language **R** and presented in a non-technical friendly manner through a presentation created in **R Markdown**.
